# ALU-VHDL-Project

A university project to make a functional ALU on a Nexys4DDR FPGA. The binary inputs were put in using a set of 16 swithces, these values were converted to decimal and shown on an eight-digit seven-segment display. After the two operands were entered one of three operations was entered as a four-bit number. The result would then be shown on the display in decimal. The ALU was capable of performing, AND, OR, addition, subtraction and multiplication.
