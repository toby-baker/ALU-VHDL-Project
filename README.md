# ALU-VHDL-Project

A university project to make a functional ALU on a Nexys4DDR FPGA. The binary inputs were put in using a set of 16 swithces, these values were converted to decimal and shown on an eight-digit seven-segment display. After the two operands were entered one of three operations was entered as a four-bit number. The result would then be shown on the display in decimal. The ALU was capable of performing, AND, OR, addition, subtraction and multiplication.

The source file also contains two test benches - one for the binary to binary coded decimal converter and another for the finite state machine.
